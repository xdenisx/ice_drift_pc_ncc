align.py : Script for aligning two images given a drift vector field.

Param 1: Path to parent directory of all collocated image pairs
Param 2: Path to parent directory of all retrieved drifts
Param 3: Path to parent directory intended for all outputs
Param 4: Which transform type to use.
Param 5: Order of polynomial if polynomial transformation is used.

"""
tiff_areas.py : Script for computing the area spanned by a geotiff image (or the overlapping area spanned by two geotiff images).


Param 1: Path to first image
Param 2: The resolution [in meters per pixel (in each direction)]. For instance, a value of 100 would mean that a pixel corresponds to a 100 x 100 m^2 area.
Param 3: Path to a second image. If not given, the script computes the (active) area of the first image. If given, the script computes the overlapping (active) area of the two images.
